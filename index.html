        <h3>I am a xxx</h3>
        <p>I started out with analog photography (also known as film photography) when I was 16 years old. As digital technology took over I started to explore this field and still am continuously improving my skills. My strengths are portraits as well as black and white photographs. Furthermore, I am very skilled in completing the memory of your special event into a beautifully styled book.</p>

        <h3>I am a hiker</h3>
        <p>I have done several hikes on different levels from 5 up to 8 hours including haute routes and climbing sections. I particularly love doing long distance hikes. Apart from several long distance routes in Switzerland I have hiked the West Highland Way (94 miles) in Schottland as well as part of the South West Coast Path in England and part of the Pembrokshire Coast Path in Wales.</p>
